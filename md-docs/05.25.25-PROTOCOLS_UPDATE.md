You've raised a very important point about moving from reactive fixes to proactive standardization. This is crucial for improving development velocity, maintainability, and scalability, especially given our stack and future plans. Based on our recent experiences and your project goals, here's an analysis of our protocol landscape and suggestions for new and updated protocols:

## ðŸŒŸ New Protocols Needed:

To address the types of issues we've been tackling (token handling, endpoint consistency, store management, API client structure) and to prepare for future growth, I recommend establishing the following new protocols:

1.  **SvelteKit API Endpoint Standardization Protocol:**
    *   **Why:** We've encountered "Failed to fetch" errors and inconsistencies in how frontend calls SvelteKit backend routes.
    *   **Scope:** This protocol would govern the creation of `+server.js` files.
        *   Standard request handling patterns (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        *   Consistent use of `event.locals` for authentication/authorization (especially with Better Auth data).
        *   Mandatory input validation and sanitization for request data (query params, body).
        *   Defined success/error response formats (e.g., `{ success: true, data: {...} }` or `{ success: false, error: { code: "...", message: "..." } }`).
        *   Guidelines for SvelteKit endpoints that proxy or interact with the WordPress REST API.
        *   Standardized logging within API handlers.

2.  **Frontend API Client/Service Protocol:**
    *   **Why:** We recently refactored `digest-builder.js` to centralize API call logic. This should be a standard pattern.
    *   **Scope:** Define how frontend modules/services that make API calls (like `digest-builder.js`) are structured.
        *   Central API base URL management (we have `getApiUrl`).
        *   Standardized header creation (e.g., the `getApiHeaders` function we developed for `digest-builder.js`, including auth token handling).
        *   Consistent error handling, response parsing, and data transformation from API responses.
        *   Guidelines on using `fetch` and `credentials: 'include'`.
        *   JSDoc typing for all API client functions, detailing parameters and expected response shapes.
        *   Client-side caching strategies for API responses, where appropriate.

3.  **Global Authentication & Session Management Protocol (Cross-Cutting):**
    *   **Why:** Token handling, cookie names, and session data flow across SvelteKit, Better Auth, and WordPress have been complex and led to several bugs. This protocol would provide a unified approach.
    *   **Scope:**
        *   **Token Lifecycle:** Definitive rules for session token (e.g., `better_auth_session`) storage (cookies), attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite, Path, Expires), and primary source of truth.
        *   **Session Data Flow:** Clear mapping of how user/session data propagates: `hooks.server.js` (token validation, user fetching) -> `event.locals` -> `+layout.server.js` (passing to page data) -> Svelte stores on the client.
        *   **Frontend Session Interaction:** Standardized way for the frontend to securely access session status (e.g., via `/api/auth/session`) or trigger session-related actions.
        *   **Inter-Service Authentication:** Define how SvelteKit server routes authenticate to WordPress REST APIs if they need to make calls on behalf of the user (e.g., forwarding the Better Auth token).
        *   **Store Synchronization:** Rules for synchronizing auth state between different client-side stores if necessary (e.g., a raw Better Auth store vs. the processed `user.js` store).

4.  **Svelte Store Management Protocol:**
    *   **Why:** You mentioned `@user.js` and other stores. We need a consistent approach to state management on the client.
    *   **Scope:**
        *   Guidelines on when to create new stores vs. extending existing ones.
        *   Naming conventions for stores, actions, and getters/selectors (like `getUserData`).
        *   Recommended structure for store modules (e.g., combining `writable` with exported helper functions for mutations and derivations).
        *   Best practices for synchronizing stores with `localStorage` (as seen in `userStore`).
        *   How stores should interact with API client services for data fetching and updates.
        *   Effective use of Svelte's `derived` stores.
        *   Patterns for managing store subscriptions and unsubscriptions to prevent memory leaks and ensure reactivity.
        *   Define how complex data objects within stores should be typed using JSDoc (referencing `type-definition-management-protocol.mdc`).

5.  **WordPress REST API Development Protocol (Advanced):**
    *   **Why:** The current `@wordpress-ajax-handler-standardization-protocol.mdc` is excellent for `admin-ajax.php`. However, much of our new backend work (like `class-rest-digest-builder.php`) uses the more modern WP REST API (`/wp-json/`).
    *   **Scope:**
        *   Guidelines for extending `REST_Base` or a similar custom base class for our API controllers.
        *   Standard patterns for `register_rest_route` arguments, including namespace and versioning strategies (e.g., `/asap/v1/`, `/asap/v2/`).
        *   **Crucially:** Secure and consistent implementation of `permission_callback`, especially how to integrate Better Auth token validation (e.g., using a helper like `get_authenticated_user_id` we developed in `class-rest-digest-builder.php`).
        *   Standardized input parameter validation and sanitization within REST controller methods (referencing `@wordpress-method-parameter-protocol.mdc` but applied to `WP_REST_Request` objects).
        *   Consistent use of `WP_REST_Response` for success and `WP_Error` for error responses, including appropriate HTTP status codes.
        *   Caching strategies for GET requests.

## ðŸ”„ Updates to Existing Protocols:

1.  **`@wordpress-ajax-handler-standardization-protocol.mdc`:**
    *   **Update:** Add a clear note or section stating that this protocol primarily covers traditional WordPress AJAX (`admin-ajax.php`) and for custom REST endpoints (`/wp-json/`), developers should refer to the new "WordPress REST API Development Protocol."

2.  **`@asap-digest-stack.mdc`:**
    *   **Update:** Add a section titled "Key Integration & Standardization Protocols" that lists and links to all specific protocols (like the ones above, plus existing ones like `type-definition-management-protocol.mdc`, `wordpress-class-organization.mdc`, etc.). This makes the stack document a better central hub.

3.  **`@type-definition-management-protocol.mdc`:**
    *   **Review:** While generally robust, ensure it explicitly covers how to type data coming from SvelteKit API endpoints and data within Svelte stores, especially complex nested objects.

4.  **`ASAP_DIGEST_DIGEST_CREATION_FLOW.md`:**
    *   **Consider Converting to Protocol:** This detailed document is excellent. For future major features, we could adopt a "Feature Design & UX Flow Protocol" that mandates creating similar documents before implementation. This ensures UI/UX is thought out.

By establishing these new protocols and refining existing ones, we can build a more robust, consistent, and scalable system, reducing the need for reactive "after the fact" fixes and making the codebase easier for everyone to work with.

What are your thoughts on these suggestions? Are there any areas you feel need more immediate attention or a different approach?
