# Update Memory & System State Protocol v2.2

*(Self-correction: v2.1 - Added State Sync Verification; v2.2 - Mandated trigger reason logging)*

## 1. Purpose
This protocol defines the standard operating procedure for the "Update Memory" (`um`) alias. It serves as a crucial integration point following task completion or significant state changes, ensuring that Server Memory, relevant documentation, and overall system state remain consistent and synchronized. It integrates workflows from Task Tracking, Work Session Management, and Server Memory rules.

## 2. Activation
- **Command:** "Update Memory"
- **Alias:** `um`
- **Context:** Typically invoked after completing a task segment within an active work session (managed by `work-session-management-protocol.mdc`), before formally ending the session (`EWS`), or when needing to manually synchronize state changes.

## 3. Protocol Integration Layer
This protocol orchestrates updates across multiple system components.

*(Self-correction: Updated integrated protocol versions)*

## 4. Core Actions & Sequence
Executing `um` triggers the following sequence:

1.  **Timestamp Acquisition:**
    -   MUST acquire the current timestamp using the logic defined in `format-time.mdc v1.1+` (fetch ISO, format to "MM.DD.YY | HH:MM AM/PM `TimeZone`" for documentation updates).
    -   Use `mcp-datetime_get_datetime` tool with appropriate format specifiers for base timestamp.

2.  **Server Memory Update:**
    -   MUST update Server Memory according to `server-memory-rules.mdc`.
    -   This typically involves:
        -   Updating the status of the relevant `Task` entity (e.g., to `COMPLETED` or another appropriate state).
        -   **Adding observations to the `Task` entity detailing the update, timestamp, AND the specific trigger/reason for the update (e.g., "Task status updated to COMPLETED following AC command for VerificationRequest XYZ").** (MANDATORY - Show Work)
        -   Creating/updating `Code`, `Build`, or `Error` entities if relevant to the completed work.
        -   Creating necessary relations (e.g., `Task` `completedIn` `WorkSession`).
    -   Reference the active `WorkSession` entity (from WSMP context) when creating relations.

3.  **Roadmap Task Update (`md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md`):**
    -   MUST update the status and completion tag for the completed task(s) in `md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md`.
    -   Use the Task Tracking Protocol's logic (implicit) to find the task line by its `[ PREFIX-Num ]` ID and update its status emoji (e.g., ✅) and append the ` • [ done:MM.DD.YY ]` tag (using the acquired formatted date).
    -   Example format: `- ✅ [ AUTH-1 ] Create login page • [ done:04.23.25 ]`
    -   All other tags (e.g., `rnk`, `due`, `src`) must be preserved and remain in the correct order as per the standard.

3.a. **Execute State Synchronization Verification (MUST):** MUST execute the sequence defined in `mandatory-post-update-state-synchronization-verification-protocol.mdc v1.0` to ensure consistency between the `Task` entity status/timestamp in Server Memory (updated in Step 2) and the status/completion tag in `md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md` (updated in Step 3). Trigger UERP on failure.

4.  **Main Roadmap Check (`md-docs/ASAP_DIGEST_ROADMAP.md`):**
    -   SHOULD review if the completed functionality was significantly outside the scope defined in the main roadmap.
    -   If necessary, update `md-docs/ASAP_DIGEST_ROADMAP.md` to reflect scope changes or additions.

5.  **Deployment Checklist Update (`md-docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`):**
    -   MUST update `md-docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` if the completed work affects deployment steps, configuration, or verification procedures. Add new items or check off existing ones as appropriate.

6.  **Verification & Audit:**
    -   MUST ensure relevant events (e.g., `TASK_UPDATE`, `MEMORY_SYNC`) are logged via the Audit Trail System.

## 5. Example Flow (Conceptual)

```bash
# --- (Inside an active Work Session managed by WSMP) ---

# User completes coding for Task 'Create login page' (ID: AUTH-1)

# User triggers the update memory alias
um

# --- (Agent Executes Protocol 'update-memory.mdc v2.2') ---

# 1. Agent gets timestamp -> "04.23.25"
#    (Using mcp-datetime_get_datetime with 'iso' format + format-time.mdc v1.1+ string formatting logic)

# 2. Agent updates Server Memory:
#    - Finds Task entity 'AUTH-1'
#    - Updates status to 'COMPLETED'
#    - Adds observation: "Status updated to COMPLETED at 04.23.25. Trigger: 'um' command after manual completion verification by user."
#    - Creates relations: AUTH-1 completedIn WS_XYZ
#    (Using mcp_Server_Memory_* tools according to server-memory-rules.mdc)

# 3. Agent updates md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md:
#    - Finds line for '[ AUTH-1 ] Create login page'
#    - Updates line to: "- ✅ [ AUTH-1 ] Create login page • [ done:04.23.25 ]"
#    (Preserves all other tags, e.g., rnk, due, src)
#    (Using edit_file tool)

# 4.a. **Execute State Synchronization Verification:** MUST execute the full sequence defined in `mandatory-post-update-state-synchronization-verification-protocol.mdc v1.0` to ensure consistency between the `Task` entity status/timestamp in Server Memory (updated in Step 2) and the status/completion tag in `md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md` (updated in Step 3). Trigger UERP on failure.

# 5. Agent reviews md-docs/ASAP_DIGEST_ROADMAP.md (No changes needed)

# 5. Agent updates md-docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md:
#    - Adds item: "- Verify login form styles on staging"
#    (Using edit_file tool)

# 6. Agent performs verification checks (Pass)
#    - Logs events to Audit Trail

# --- (Agent confirms completion of 'um' alias) ---

# User can now optionally end the work session (EWS) or continue
