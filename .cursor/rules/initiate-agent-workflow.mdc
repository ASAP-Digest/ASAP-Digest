1. **Begin Work Protocol**
   - Begin by Running "Status Check" or "SC"
   - Review `@PE - CTXT` - to understand project structure & configuration (DO NOT OUTPUT)
   - Set "## üõ†Ô∏è Operational Context" using `pwd` command + `OP` from `SC`
   - Clock in using format: ### üïö "MM.DD.YY | HH:MM AM/PM `TimeZone`"
   - Check working directory: `pwd`

     - WordPress `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/vsmith/Local Sites/asap-digest/app/public`
   - Check Server Status: `lsof -i :5173`
     - If OFF - Start Server with `prd` command
     - If ON - Begin Agent Work: Write Code or solve problems in immediate `OP` **DO NOT WAIT FOR ME TO TELL YOU TO WORK.**
