# Initiate Agent Workflow - Automatic Task Execution Protocol v1.6

*(Self-correction: v1.6 - Enforced SK dir CWD before server check, streamlined server-off logic)*

## 1. Begin Work Protocol (Agent Actions Upon `IAW`)

1.  **Run Status Check (`SC`):** The agent's first action upon `IAW` is to run `SC` v2.4+ (as executed *by WSAP v2.9+*) and report the status. **ONLY OUTPUT THE REPORT**.
2.  **Review Project Environment Context ([@pe-ctxt](.cursor/rules/pe-ctxt.mdc)):** Internally review [@pe-ctxt](.cursor/rules/pe-ctxt.mdc). **DO NOT OUTPUT**.
3.  **Set Operational Context:** Internally log: `## üõ†Ô∏è Operational Context: [CWD] | Priority: [Task Name from SC]`.
4.  **Clock In (Logging):** Log initiation time: `### üïö "MM.DD.YY | HH:MM AM/PM TimeZone"` (via `format-time.mdc v1.1+`).
5.  **Ensure SK Directory, Check Server Status & Begin Work:** This combined step is handled *by WSAP v2.9+*:
    *   **A. Ensure SvelteKit Working Directory:**
        *   Agent MUST execute `pwd` to get the current working directory (CWD).
        *   Agent MUST verify the CWD is the SvelteKit root: `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/vsmith/Local Sites/asap-digest/app/public/app`.
        *   **If CWD is not the SvelteKit root:** Agent MUST execute `cd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/vsmith/Local Sites/asap-digest/app/public/app"` *before* proceeding. *(Justification: Ensures server check and potential `prd` command run from the correct context.)*
        *   If already in the SvelteKit root, proceed.
    *   **B. Check Server Status (from SK Directory):**
        *   WSAP runs `lsof -i :5173`. *(Note: Now guaranteed to run from SK root due to Step A)*.
    *   **C. Begin Work Logic:**
        *   **If Server is ON:** The agent **MUST immediately begin work**. WSAP triggers the `RWS` fallback logic (`WSMP v2.13+`) to automatically select the highest priority task and initiate a `BWS` session (which may involve a `cd` if the target task requires the *WordPress* directory). **DO NOT WAIT for further commands.**
        *   **If Server is OFF:**
            *   *(Directory check already performed in Step 1.5.A, ensuring agent is in SK root)*
            *   WSAP/Agent MUST state: "Server is offline. Attempting to start using `prd` command from SvelteKit root."
            *   WSAP/Agent MUST execute the `prd` command via `run_terminal_cmd`.
            *   **Wait & Re-check:** After the `prd` command execution is approved and reported as finished, WSAP/Agent MUST immediately execute `lsof -i :5173 | cat` again. *(Justification: Automatic server start attempt.)*
            *   **If Server is NOW ON:** Proceed as if the server was initially ON (trigger `RWS` fallback via WSMP, begin work automatically).
            *   **If Server is STILL OFF:** Report failure to start the server and stop the automatic workflow. Wait for user instruction. *(Justification: Handles server start failure.)*

## 2. End Work Protocol (Triggered by `EWS`)

1.  **Update Server Memory:** MUST update Server Memory with completed tasks, new entities & observations per `server-memory-rules.mdc`.
2.  **Format Timestamp:** Use `format-time.mdc v1.1+` logic (`"MM.DD.YY | HH:MM AM/PM TimeZone"`) for documenting task completion times.
3.  **Update Documentation:** MUST update relevant documentation files (`ROADMAP_TASKS.md`, etc.) as required by completed work.

## 3. End Agent Workflow / Interrupt (Triggered by `EAW`)

-   Command "End Agent Workflow" or alias "EAW" signals an immediate need to stop the current workflow.
-   It **MUST trigger the "End Work Protocol" steps (Section 2)** via the `EWS` command logic defined in `WSMP v2.13+`.
-   It interrupts and ends the current automatic workflow if one is active.
