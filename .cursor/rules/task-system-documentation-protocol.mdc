# Task System Documentation Protocol v1.1

*(Self-correction: Updated version to v1.1 to add detail on philosophy, configuration, and expand existing sections)*

## 1. Purpose

This protocol provides a comprehensive overview and documentation for the project's task management system (initially developed for ASAP Digest, but designed as a core VeriDX component). This system facilitates **systematic development** by establishing a **single source of truth** for tasks in a human-readable format, enabling automated processing for prioritized, actionable views.

It relies on a Markdown-based roadmap (`md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md`), a Node.js script (`generate-todotxt.js`) for processing, and a `todo.txt`-formatted file (`md-docs/todotasks.txt`) as the primary machine-readable output, supporting CLI-centric workflows and future integrations.

## 2. Design Philosophy & Goals

*   **Single Source of Truth:** `md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md` is the definitive source for task definitions, status, hierarchy, and metadata. All other views are derived from this.
*   **Human-Readable & Editable:** The Markdown format allows for easy manual editing, review, and version control of the task list.
*   **Automated Processing:** The `generate-todotxt.js` script provides consistent, repeatable parsing and formatting, reducing manual effort and errors.
*   **Prioritized Actionable Output:** The `todotasks.txt` file leverages `todo.txt` conventions and custom sorting logic (especially RWS) to present a clear, prioritized list suitable for command-line task management or integration with `todo.txt` tools.
*   **Integration Hub:** The roadmap file serves as a central point referenced by other VeriDX protocols (Status Check, WSMP) for context and decision-making.
*   **Extensibility:** The tag-based metadata system (` • [ key:value ]`) is designed to be extensible for future requirements (effort, assignees, etc.).

## 3. Protocol Integration Layer

This documentation protocol describes a system that integrates with several operational protocols:

```

## 4. System Components

### 4.1. Source Roadmap (`md-docs/ROADMAP_TASKS.md`)

*   **Format:** Markdown.
*   **Purpose:** The **canonical source** for all project tasks. Defines their description, completion status, parent-child relationships (via Markdown headings), explicit priority (via rank tags), and optional due dates.
*   **Syntax:** MUST strictly adhere to `roadmap-syntax-validation-protocol.mdc v1.1`. Incorrect syntax may lead to parsing errors or incorrect output in `todotasks.txt`.
*   **Maintenance:** Edited manually by the user or programmatically by protocols like the Task Tracking Protocol (primarily for status/timestamp updates).

### 4.2. Generation Script (`generate-todotxt.js`)

*   **Language:** Node.js.
*   **Purpose:** Acts as the **processor** that transforms the hierarchical, human-readable roadmap into a flat, prioritized, `todo.txt`-compatible list.
    *   Parses status emojis, descriptions, rank tags, and due date tags.
    *   Derives `src:+` tags from Markdown heading hierarchy.
    *   Applies sorting based on the `CURRENT_SORT_MODE` constant (RWS default).
    *   Formats output lines according to project conventions (Section 7).
    *   Includes validation logic to warn about malformed tags.
*   **Execution Control:** The `LIST_GENERATION` constant within the script determines if it runs when triggered automatically (by Git hooks or file watchers) or only when run manually. See script header comments for details.

### 4.3. Output Task List (`md-docs/todotasks.txt`)

*   **Format:** `todo.txt` (with specific project conventions detailed in Section 7).
*   **Purpose:** Provides a **prioritized, actionable view** of non-completed tasks, suitable for quick reference, CLI tools, or potential future GUI integrations. Completed tasks are included at the end for archival purposes.
*   **Generation:** This file is **automatically generated** and **overwritten** by `generate-todotxt.js`. **Manual edits will be lost.**

## 5. Roadmap Syntax Summary (Key Elements)

*(Refer to `roadmap-syntax-validation-protocol.mdc v1.0+` for the full specification and validation rules)*

*   **Task Line:** Starts with `- <emoji> ` (e.g., `- ⏳ `).
*   **Hierarchy:** Defined by Markdown headings (`##`, `###`, etc.). Used for `src:+` tags.
*   **Rank Tag (Optional):** ` • [ rnk:X ]` (X=A-Z). Appears before timestamp. Used for RWS sorting.
*   **Due Date Tag (Optional):** ` • [ due:MM.DD.YY ]`. Appears before timestamp.
*   **Timestamps:** Status/completion timestamps often appear at the end.

## 6. Script Logic Summary (`generate-todotxt.js`)

1.  **Read & Parse:** Reads `ROADMAP_TASKS.md`. Iterates line by line.
    *   Identifies headings to track hierarchy for `src:+` tags.
    *   Identifies task lines based on `- <emoji> ` prefix.
    *   Extracts status, description.
    *   Uses regex (`/\s*•\s*\[\s*rnk:([A-Z])\s*\]/g`) to find and extract rank (`X`), removes tag from description.
    *   Uses regex (`/\s*•\s*\[\s*due:(\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{2})\s*\]/g`) to find and extract due date (`MM.DD.YY`), removes tag from description.
    *   Logs warnings for malformed or multiple tags per line.
2.  **Sort:** Sorts the parsed task objects based on `CURRENT_SORT_MODE`.
    *   **RWS:** Rank (A-Z) -> Status Group -> Depth (for In Progress) -> Original Order. Completed last.
    *   **ALPHA:** Alphabetical description. Completed last.
3.  **Format & Assign Priority:** Iterates through sorted, *non-completed* tasks.
    *   If RWS mode and `rnk:X` exists, use `X` for `(X)` priority.
    *   Otherwise (RWS mode, no rank), assign next sequential priority `(A)`, `(B)`, etc.
    *   Formats the line according to Section 7, adding context tags (`@status`), `src:+`, `due:`, `done:` tags.
4.  **Format Completed:** Formats completed tasks (prepends `x `, adds `@completed`, adds `done:` tag).
5.  **Write Output:** Joins formatted lines (incomplete prioritized, then completed) and writes to `todotasks.txt`, overwriting previous content.

## 7. Output Format (`md-docs/todotasks.txt`)

A typical line follows this structure, with metadata tags ordered specifically:

`[CompletionMarker|Priority] [@StatusContext] Task Description - [ src:+Source ] - [ due:MM.DD.YY ] - [ done:MM.DD.YY ] - [ ts:Completion_Timestamp ]`

*   **CompletionMarker:** `x ` (space included) if task is complete.
*   **Priority:** `(A)` to `(Z)` assigned based on RWS sort logic (rank tag or sequential). Only for non-completed tasks.
*   **StatusContext:** `@paused`, `@testing`, `@inprogress`, `@pending`, `@blocked`, `@pendingtesting`, `@completed`.
*   **Task Description:** Cleaned description from roadmap (rank/due tags removed).
*   **Metadata Separator:** ` - ` (space, hyphen, space) separates description from the first metadata tag AND subsequent metadata tags.
*   **Metadata Order (MUST be followed):**
    1.  `src:+Source` (Derived from roadmap heading hierarchy)
    2.  `due:MM.DD.YY` (Optional due date from roadmap. MUST use MM.DD.YY format.)
    3.  `done:MM.DD.YY` (Present only for completed (`x `) tasks. MUST use MM.DD.YY format. This tag is generated by the script from the ` • [ done:MM.DD.YY ]` roadmap tag.)
    4.  `ts:Formatted_Timestamp` (Optional timestamp reflecting original completion/pause time from roadmap, primarily for context. Format may vary.)

**Example Lines:**

```todotxt
(A) @pending Pending bi-directional user synchronization testing - src:+DevelopCoreApplicationScreens_Subtask3.3:CreateLoginandRegistrationScreens - due:04.22.25
(B) @pending Fix login redirect issue - src:+Task2:BugFixes - due:04.15.25
(C) @inprogress Implement main algorithm - src:+Task1:MajorFeature_Subtask1.1:CoreLogic
x @completed Initial setup complete - src:+Task1:MajorFeature_Subtask1.1:CoreLogic - done:04.10.25 - ts:04.10.25_|_10:00_AM_PDT
```

**Key Format Requirements:**
*   The order of `src:`, `due:`, `done:`, `ts:` tags MUST be maintained as specified above when generated by the script.
*   `due:` tag value MUST be in `MM.DD.YY` format.
*   `done:` tag value MUST be in `MM.DD.YY` format and ONLY present for completed tasks.
*   The `ts:` tag captures the original timestamp string from the roadmap for reference and MAY have a different format.

## 8. Integrations

*   **Status Check Protocol (`SC`):** Directly reads `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` to report current status, including emoji states and timestamps.
*   **Work Session Management Protocol (`WSMP`):** Reads `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` during the `RWS` fallback logic to determine the next task based on rank (` • [ rnk:X ]`) and status emoji priority.
*   **Task Tracking Protocol:** Responsible for updating the status emojis and timestamps in `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` as tasks progress.
*   **`generate-todotxt.js` Script:** Consumes `ROADMAP_TASKS.md`, produces `todotasks.txt`.
*   **Automation (Optional):**
    *   **Git Hooks (`lint-staged` in `package.json`):** Can be configured to run `generate-todotxt.js` automatically when `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` is committed, ensuring `todotasks.txt` stays in sync (requires `LIST_GENERATION = GENERATE_LIST.GIT` in script).
    *   **File Watcher (`watch-roadmap.js`):** Can be set up to run `generate-todotxt.js` automatically whenever `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` is saved (requires separate setup, background process, and `LIST_GENERATION = GENERATE_LIST.FILE_SAVE` in script).

## 9. Configuration

*   **Current:** Core behavior (sorting mode, automatic generation trigger) is configured via constants (`CURRENT_SORT_MODE`, `LIST_GENERATION`) directly within the `generate-todotxt.js` script file.
*   **Future Potential:** Configuration could be moved to a dedicated section within the main VeriDX configuration file (`.cursor/veridx/veridx-config.json`), potentially under `protocolSettings` or a new `taskSystemSettings` key. This would allow users to adjust sorting, trigger behavior, and potentially validation severity without modifying the script code.

## 10. Future Plans

*   **Visualizations:** Enhance visibility beyond the text file:
    *   **GUI Integration:** Develop a Svelte component for the VeriDX Admin UI (or a standalone tool) that reads `todotasks.txt` or parses `ROADMAP_TASKS.md` directly to display an interactive task board, timeline, or list view.
    *   **Terminal UI:** Create a CLI command or script using libraries like `chalk`, `blessed`, or `ink` to render a more visually appealing and potentially interactive task list in the terminal (e.g., using colors for status, progress bars, ASCII art).
*   **Metadata Expansion:** Extend the roadmap syntax and script parser to support additional optional metadata tags, such as:
    *   ` • [ effort:S|M|L|XL ]` for task sizing.
    *   ` • [ assignee:@username|team ]` for responsibility tracking.
    *   ` • [ epic:EPIC-ID ]` for linking to larger initiatives.
*   **ID Synchronization:** Enhance the script and roadmap syntax to robustly handle explicit Task IDs (e.g., `[ T-123 ]`) present in the roadmap, ensuring they are consistently reflected or used for linking within `todotasks.txt` or other system components.
*   **Error Handling:** Improve script robustness with more specific error messages and potentially options to halt generation on critical syntax errors.
