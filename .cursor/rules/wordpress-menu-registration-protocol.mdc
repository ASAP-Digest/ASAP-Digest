# WordPress Menu Registration Protocol

1. **Centralization**
   - All menu registration MUST be in ONE location
   - Use a single initialization function (e.g., `plugin_prefix_init_menus`)
   - Register function with `admin_menu` action hook

2. **Function Organization**
   - Define ALL callback functions BEFORE menu registration
   - Place callbacks in a dedicated section of the file
   - Document each callback with PHPDoc comments

3. **Registration Order**
   - Register main menu first
   - Register submenus immediately after parent
   - Use consistent priority values

4. **Security & Standards**
   - Use WordPress capabilities (e.g., 'manage_options')
   - Never use role names directly (e.g., 'administrator')
   - Follow WordPress naming conventions

5. **Documentation**
   - Document menu structure in comments
   - Include callback function references
   - Note any dependencies
