# New Rule Creation Protocol v1.1

*(Self-correction: Added v1.1 and Master Index update requirement)*

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the systematic process for identifying the need for, drafting, refining, integrating, and documenting new rules (`.mdc` files) within the VeriDX system. It standardizes the creation process, often triggered by recurring errors or identified gaps in existing procedures, ensuring new rules are effective, well-formatted, integrated, and maintainable.

```

## 3. Activation & Trigger Conditions

This protocol is typically initiated when:

-   **Error Resolution:** A recurring error or category of errors is identified through the `Universal Error Resolution Protocol (UERP)`, suggesting a need for a preventative rule.
-   **Process Gap:** A gap in standardization or procedure is identified during development or review, requiring a new rule to ensure consistency or efficiency.
-   **New Feature/Technology:** Introduction of a new technology, pattern, or significant feature necessitates a guiding protocol.
-   **Explicit User Request:** The user explicitly requests the creation of a new rule.

## 4. Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Problem Definition & Analysis (UERP Integration)

1.  **Identify Need:** Clearly articulate the problem the new rule aims to solve or the process it intends to standardize.
2.  **Error Description (If Applicable):** If triggered by an error (via UERP), accurately and comprehensively describe the error, its symptoms, and its occurrences.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis (UERP):** Determine the fundamental cause of the error or process gap.
4.  **Categorization:** Categorize the problem domain (e.g., "UI Consistency", "State Management", "Dependency Handling", "Security", "Formatting").
5.  **Existing Rule Check:** Verify that no existing rule adequately addresses the identified problem. Search `<available_instructions>`, Server Memory/Docs, and `.cursor/rules/index.mdc`.

### Step 2: Draft Initial Specific Rule

1.  **Focused Solution:** Draft the initial version of the rule to directly address the *specific* instance of the problem or error category identified in Step 1.
2.  **Core Principle:** Clearly state the core principle or behavior the rule enforces.
3.  **Actionable Steps:** Define clear, actionable steps or requirements.
4.  **Examples:** Include specific "Correct" and "Incorrect" examples relevant to the initial problem scope.

### Step 3: Generalization & Refinement

1.  **Identify Core Principle:** Re-evaluate the core principle identified in Step 2. Is it applicable more broadly?
2.  **Broaden Scope:** Refine the rule's language and steps to make it generic enough to apply universally to the *category* of problem, not just the specific instance.
3.  **Abstract Examples:** Update or add examples to illustrate the broader application of the rule.
4.  **Clarity & Testability:** Ensure the rule's requirements are unambiguous and, where possible, testable (either automatically via linters/checks or manually via checklists).
5.  **Conflict Check:** Analyze potential conflicts with existing rules. Resolve conflicts or document necessary precedence.

### Step 4: Formatting, Structure & File Standards (MANDATORY)

1.  **Adhere to Formatting Protocol:** The *entire* content of the new rule MUST strictly adhere to all requirements defined in `rule-formatting-protocol.mdc`. This includes:
    *   Single outer ` ```markdown ... ``` ` block for the rule content.
    *   Triple backticks (`` ` ``) for ALL nested code examples, configurations, or structured text blocks.
    *   Appropriate language specifiers.
2.  **File Location (MUST):** Rule files MUST be placed exclusively within the `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/` directory.
3.  **Naming Convention (MUST):** Rule filenames MUST use `kebab-case` and the `.mdc` extension (e.g., `new-component-structure-protocol.mdc`). Names should be descriptive.
4.  **Frontmatter (MUST):** Each rule file MUST begin with YAML frontmatter enclosed in `---`. At a minimum, it MUST include:
    ```yaml
    ---
    description: Short description of the rule's purpose (used in the Master Rule Index).
    globs: Optional array of glob patterns where this rule might be automatically suggested or applied. Use [] if not applicable.
    alwaysApply: Optional boolean (defaults to false). If true, indicates the rule should generally always be considered/applied.
    ---
    ```
5.  **Versioning (MUST):** Include a version number (e.g., `v1.0`) in the main heading (`# Rule Title vX.Y`).

### Step 5: Integration Planning

1.  **Identify Touchpoints:** Determine which existing protocols or workflows the new rule will interact with or modify.
2.  **Update Integrating Protocols (If Needed):** Identify if any existing protocols need updates to reference or integrate the new rule (e.g., adding checks to an enforcement protocol, updating a meta-protocol step). Plan these edits separately.
3.  **Define Verification:** Specify how adherence to the new rule will be verified (e.g., manual checklist, automated checks, integration with `ui-check.mdc` or `strict-visual-enforcement-protocol.mdc`).

### Step 6: Verification & Documentation

1.  **Self-Verification:** Review the drafted rule against this protocol's checklist (Section 8). Check for clarity, completeness, formatting adherence, and non-conflict.
2.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   **Update Master Rule Index (MUST):** Add the new rule's filename and description to the central index file (`.cursor/rules/index.mdc`) under the appropriate category, following `master-rule-index-protocol.mdc`.
    *   Add the new rule's name and description to the `<available_instructions>` list (or the system managing it).
    *   Update any protocols identified in Step 5.2.
    *   Add an entry to a relevant `CHANGELOG.md` or project documentation noting the new rule's addition.
    *   Optionally, create/update `Task` or `Documentation` entities in Server Memory.
3.  **Audit:** Record `RULE_CREATED`, `MASTER_INDEX_UPDATED` events in the Audit Trail.

### Step 7: Review & Finalization (User Driven)

1.  **Present Draft:** Present the fully formatted and documented rule draft to the user for review.
2.  **Incorporate Feedback:** Address any feedback or requested modifications from the user.
3.  **Final Approval:** Await user confirmation before considering the rule officially active and ready for enforcement/use. (The mechanism for formal activation, e.g., merging a file, depends on the project's workflow).

## 5. Rule Content Guidelines

-   Use clear, concise language.
-   Employ prescriptive keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) where appropriate (RFC 2119).
-   Provide concrete examples.
-   Focus on preventing the root cause identified in Step 1.
-   Ensure rules are maintainable and understandable.

## 6. Verification Checklist (for the New Rule)

*(Self-correction: Added checklist item for index update)*

-   [ ] Does the rule address a clearly defined need/problem?
-   [ ] Is the core principle clearly stated?
-   [ ] Are the steps/requirements actionable and unambiguous?

-   [ ] Does the formatting strictly adhere to `rule-formatting-protocol.mdc`?
-   [ ] Does the file location and naming adhere to standards (Step 4)?
-   [ ] Does the rule include the required frontmatter (Step 4)?
