# New File Protocol

1.  **Location Context Verification**
    *   MUST Check current location `pwd` against relevant target directory specified in `@PE - CTXT` (e.g., SvelteKit Root, WordPress Root).
    *   **MUST explicitly state the current CWD (from `pwd` result) and the required CWD (from `@PE - CTXT`).**
    *   **MUST confirm they match OR state the exact `cd` command needed to reach the required CWD.**
    *   If `cd` is needed, execute it *before* proceeding to Step 2.

2.  **File Existence Check**
    *   Once in the correct directory (verified in Step 1), check if file exists using `ls -la [file-name]`.
    *   Wait for output.

3.  **File Creation (If Necessary)**
    *   If the file does *not* exist (verified in Step 2), create the new file using `touch [file-name]`.
